I don't wanna be hostile
I don't wanna be dismal
And I don't wanna rot in an apathetic existence
See I wanna believe you
And I wanted to trust you
And I wanna have faith to put away the dagger

But you lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
And I tolerate you
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
How can I tolerate?

Veil of virtue hung to hide your method
While I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your praise and glory
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma
As I smile and laugh and dance and
Sing your glory while

You lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
I cannot tolerate you
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
I cannot tolerate

Our guilt, our blame, I've been far too sympathetic
Our blood, our fault, I've been far too sympathetic

I'm not innocent
I'm not innocent
You are not innocent
No one is innocent

Lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
You lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal
Lie, cheat and steal

I cannot tolerate you

I will not tolerate you
I will go down beside you
I must go down beside you
No one is innocent

It took so long to remember just what happened
I was so young and vestal then you know it hurt me
But I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise

I've got my hands bound
And my head down,
And my eyes closed
My throat's wide open

I do unto others what has been done to me
Do unto others what has been done to you

I'm treading water
I need to sleep a while
My lamb and martyr,
You look so precious

Won't you—won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you

I need you to feel this
I can't stand to burn too long
Released in sodomy
For one sweet moment I am whole

I do unto you now what has been done to me
Do unto you now what has been done

You're breathing so I guess you're still alive
Even if signs seem to tell me otherwise

Won't you—won't you come on a bit closer
Close enough so I can smell you

I need you to feel this
I need this to make me whole
Released in sodomy
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted
Have you witnessed that blood and flesh can't be trusted
And only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind

Got your hands bound,
And your head down
And your eyes closed
You look so precious now

I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this
Shit blood and cum on my hands
I've come round full circle

My lamb and martyr,
This will be over soon

You look so precious
You look so precious
You look so precious
You look so precious
You look so precious
You look so precious

There's a shadow just behind me,
Shrouding every step I take,
Making every promise empty,
Pointing every finger at me.
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests.
Murder now the path of "must we"
Just because the son has come.

Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Something but the past is done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we drink forever?
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down.

Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Something but the past is done?

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over.

I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me

Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start things over.
Why can't we sleep forever?
I just want to start this over.

I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want
I want what I want

Compassion is broken now
My will is eroded now
Desire is broken now
It makes me feel ugly
I'm on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
So smell my soul is burning
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy
I have swallowed the poison you feed me
But I survive on the poison you feed me, and it leaves me
Guilt-fed, hatred-fed, weakness-fed
It makes me feel ugly
I’m on my knees and burning
My piss and moans are the fuel
That set my head on fire
Dead inside
Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up at the bottom


If I let you, you would make me destroy myself
In order to survive you, I must first survive myself
And I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you
There’s no choice but to confront you
To engage you
To erase you
I’ve gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain
I will use my mistakes against you
There’s no other choice
Shameless now, nameless now, nothing now, no one now
And my soul must be iron
Cause my fear is naked
I’m naked and fearless
And my fear is naked

Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside
Nameless now, shameless now
Nothing now, no one now

Shit adds up, shit adds up
Shit adds up, as you see me
Naked now, fearless now
Naked now, fearless now

Shit adds... shit adds...
Shit adds... shit adds up it leaves me
Dead inside, dead inside
Dead inside, dead inside

Hatred keeps me alive
Hungriness keeps me alive
Weakness keeps me alive
Guilt keeps me alive at the bottom


Crawled away from me.
Slipped away from me.
Tried to keep a hold,
But there was nothing I could say.

Slid away from me.
Crept away from me.
Tried to keep you down,
But there was nothing I could say.

What you trying to say?
That you don't wanna play?
What you want and what you need,
don't mean that much to me.

I can see your back is turning.
If I could I'd stick a knife in.
Love.

Get it, get it, get it,
Raah

What you want and what you need
don't make a fuck to me.

I can see your back is turning.
If I could I’d stick a knife in.

My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in
You're wading knee deep and going in

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
'Cause you're a stupid, belligerent fucker

'Cause you're a dumb and belligerent fucker!

No one even invited you
And you still stumble and suffocate, suffocate

Wandering around got you in
No one even invited you
And you still stumble and suffocate, suffocate
Why don't you get out while you can?

No one told you to come

Two times in.

I've been struck dumb by a voice that
speaks, from deep beneath peerless water that's,
twice as clear as heaven,
twice as loud as reason.
Deep and rich like silt on a riverbed,
just as neverending.
Current's mouth below me;
opens up around me.
suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
Surrounds and drowns, and wipes me away.

But I'm so comfortable... So comfortable.

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,
you're saturating me.
How could I let this bring me,
back to my knees?

Third time in.

I've been baptized by your voice that,
screams, from deep beneath the cold black water that's,
half as high as heaven,
half as clear as reason.
cold and black like silt on the riverbed.
Just as neverending.
Current's mouth below me;
opens up around me.
Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.
Surrounds and drowns, and wipes me away.

But I'm so comfortable... So comfortable.

Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up,
you're saturating me.
How could I let this happen?

Why don't you kill me?
I am weak and numb and insignificant,
How could I let this bring me back to my knees?

Eu...phor...ia.
Eu...phor...ia.
Eu...phor...ia.
Eu...phor...ia.

I'm back down, I'm in the undertow.
I'm helpless and I'm awake, I'm in the undertow.
I'll die beneath the undertow.
There doesn't seem to be a way out of the undertow.

Eu..phor..ia.

Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now
Get up, get up now

Free yourself from yourself
Free yourself from yourself 
Free yourself from yourself 
Free yourself from yourself 

Locked up inside you
Like the calm beneath castles
A cavern of treasures that
No one has been to
Let's go digging
Let's go digging
Bring it out and take it back in

You won't do what you'd like to do
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it all
Take it all in

All the way in
All the way in
Let it go
Let it go in

You won't feel what you'd like to feel
Lay back and let me show you another way

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Knock me down
I'll just come back running
Knock you down
It won't be long now
All the way in
All the way in
All the way
All the way
Way in!

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it away

Take it up, take it up higher
4 degrees now, 4 degrees warmer
Give in now
Give in now

Let me in!

You'll like this in
This brings us out
You'll like this
It brings us closer than
Dying and cancer and crying
Let's take it, take it...

Kill what you want to
Take what's left and eat it
Take all or nothing
Just too short to push it

Just like that
Just like that
Just like...


Here comes the water

All I knew and all I believed
Are crumbling images
That no longer comfort me
I scramble to reach higher ground
Some order and sanity
Or something to comfort me

So I take what is mine,and hold what is mine
Suffocate what is mine, and bury what's mine
Soon the water will come
And claim what is mine
I must leave it behind
And climb to a new place now

This ground is not the rock I thought it to be

Thought I was high
Thought I was free
I thought I was there
Divine destiny

I was wrong
This changes everything

The water is rising up on me
Thought the sun would come deliver me
But the truth has come to punish me instead

The ground is breaking down right under me
Cleanse and purge me
In the water

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.
And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own Midwest.
And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil.
One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then

And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"

And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!
You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."

And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,
"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you!
Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"

Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus

It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then.
That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky.
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.
Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this?

You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.
Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this.
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.
"If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin."
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?

You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked.
It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them.
Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too
