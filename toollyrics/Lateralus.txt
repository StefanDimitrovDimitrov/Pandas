Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.

Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.
Humbled again.

Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.
Saturn ascends, comes round again.
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.
Desperate to control all and everything.
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.

Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control.
Unable to forgive. And sinking deeper.

Defining, confining, sinking deeper.
Controlling, defining, and we're sinking deeper.

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Let's you choose what you will, will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.

Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone to
Consume you till you choose to let this go.
Choose to let this go.

Give away the stone. Let the oceans take and
Transmutate this cold and fated anchor.
Give away the stone. Let the waters kiss and
Transmutate these leaden grudges into gold.
Let go.

A groan of tedium escapes me,
Startling the fearful.
Is this a test? It has to be,
Otherwise I can't go on.
Draining patience, drain vitality.
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith,
And I'm still right here.

Wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Be patient (wait it out).

If there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through,
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
Gonna wait it out.

If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now.

And I still may, I still may be patient, be patient, be patient.

I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.
I must keep reminding myself of this.

And if there were no rewards to reap,
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here,
I certainly would've walked away by now.
And I still may.
And I still may.
And I still may.

And I am gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.
Gonna wait it out.

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end crippling our communication

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication

(Cold, cold, cold)
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers
Between supposed brothers

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

I know the pieces fit

So familiar and overwhelmingly warm
This one, this form I hold now.
Embracing you, this reality here,
This one, this form I hold now, so
Wide eyed and hopeful.
Wide eyed and hopefully wild.

We barely remember what came before this precious moment,
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.

We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now
Hold on, stay inside...

This holy reality, this holy experience
Choosing to be here in...
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Alive!

In this holy reality, in this holy experience
Choosing to be here in...
This body, this body holding me
Be my reminder here that I am not alone in...
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Twirling round with this familiar parable
Spinning, weaving round each new experience
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing
A chance to be alive and breathing

This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality
Embrace this moment, remember, we are eternal
All this pain is an illusion

Suck and suck
Suckin' up all you can
Suckin' up all you can suck
Workin' up under my patience like a little tick
Fat little parasite

Suck me dry
My friend, bruised and borrowed
You thieving bastards
You have turned my blood cold and bitter
Beat my compassion black and blue

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting
I hope you're choking. I hope you choke on this

Taken all I can, taken all I can, fuckin' take
Taken all you can, taken all you can fuckin' take
Got nothing left to give to you

Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Blood-suckin' parasitic little tick
Take what you want and then go

Hope this is what you wanted
Hope this is what you had in mind
'Cause this is what you're getting

Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry suck
Suck me dry

Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you had in mind?
Is this what you wanted?
'Cause this this is what you're getting
I hope, I hope, I hope you choke

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me,
Lets me see.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.

Black then white are all I see
In my infancy.
Red and yellow then came to be,
Reaching out to me.
Lets me see

There is so much more
And beckons me
To look through to these
Infinite possibilities.

As below, so above and beyond,
I imagine drawn outside the lines of reason.
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.

Over-thinking, over-analyzing separates the body from the mind.
Withering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind.

Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.
Reaching out to embrace the random.
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.

I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow
To feel inspired, to fathom the power,
To witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,
To swing on the spiral, to swing on the spiral,

To swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.

With my feet upon the ground
I lose myself between the sounds
And open wide to suck it in.
I feel it move across my skin.

I'm reaching up and reaching out.
I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me.
Whatever will bewilder me.

And following our will and wind
We may just go where no one's been.
We'll ride the spiral to the end
And may just go where no one's been.

Spiral out. Keep going. 

Spiral out. Keep going.

Spiral out. Keep going.

Spiral out. Keep going.

I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,
Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me...

And in my darkest moment, feeble and weeping
The moon tells me a secret - a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me

Its source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here soothing my narcissism away.
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
Before I pine away
Before I pine away
Before I pine away (pine away)
Before I pine away...

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.
And let the light touch you
So that the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason...

Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away.

"I, I don't have a whole lot of time.
Um, OK, I'm a former employee of Area 51.
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and...
[chokes] I've kind of been running across the country.
Damn, I don't know where to start, they're,
they're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really soon.

OK, um, um, OK,
what we're thinking of as, as aliens,
they're extradimensional beings,
that, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with.
They are not what they claim to be.
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment,
particularly the Area 51.

The disasters that are coming, they, the military,
I'm sorry, the government knows about them.
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving
the population to now. They are not!
They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few
that are left will be more easily controllable."
