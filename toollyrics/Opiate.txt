I'm sweating,
and breathing
and staring and thinking
and sinking
deeper.
It's almost like I'm swimming.

The sun is burning hot again
on the hunter
and the fisherman,
and I’m trying to remember when,
but it makes me dizzy.

Seems like I've been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I'm slipping
into a dream within a dream.

Must be the way you whisper.

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

You are a part of me

You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me

Give it up

You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave
You can't hurt me
You're just here for
Me to use

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little. Give it up

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

A part of me

Throw that Bob Marley wanna-be motherfucker outta here

FADE

Underneath the skin and jewelry,
hidden in her words and eyes
is a wall that's cold and ugly
and she's scared as hell.
Trembling at the thought of feeling.
Wide awake and keeping distance.
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened
Oh oh oh.

Trembling at the thought of feeling
Wide awake and keeping distance
Nothing seems to penetrate her.
cause She's scared as hell.

I am frightened too
I am frightened

Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul.
Wide awake and
keeping distance from my soul

I am frightened too
I am frightened too
I am scared like you
I am frightened
